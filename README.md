# Pets-app

Created this app while learning on Udacity.

It is an useful app to manage the pets by adding some basic details about them.

Data about the pets can be deleted as well as edited.

Sqlite is used for database.

It also makes use of CursorLoader to fetch the list on a background thread and refresh the list displayed.
